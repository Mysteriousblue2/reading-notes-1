#How to stay in a growth mindset?

Instead of focusing on what can't be done focus on ways to make it happen.
Pay attention to the small details and write them down. They lead to the whole story.
Talk out the steps (out loud) usually helps clear any blockage of the brain.
#Stay Focused

When distractions come up, don't allow them in. Remember what's important.
If I find myself drifting or stuck; take time to walk away and come back to it.
Turn off tvs, radios, or anything that's causing me to lose focus.
#Work at it!

Think about the end result; would I be happier procrastinating or completing a task.
Don't rely on my emotions. They are not real and don't end with good results. Do it regardless of what I feel like.
It may not feel good, but the harder it is the better I feel when it's accomplished.
#Be Honest!

What went right today? How can I keep it going?
What went wrong today? How can I improve?
What am I grateful for? Where do I need more discipline?
#Celebrate Others

Congratulate others on their success, it also builds me up.
Share in the victory of someone else, it could lead to my victory.
Learn from those who've done what I'm doing and succeeded.
#Don't be afraid to grow wherever I am.
