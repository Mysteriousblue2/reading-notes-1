**What is a growth mindset?** A belief that with hardwork and perserverance I can grow and develop learning whatever it is I am attempting to achieve.
*Fixed mindset: states One has learned all he/she can and there is no more room for growth.
A Growht mindset when faced with
             >Challenges: It embraces   Obstacles: Becomes persistant   Effort: resilient pushing beyond hardships and seeing them as positive forces  criticism: learns and adapts 
             success of others: celebrates and congratulates    In the end this mindset achieves more and is more successful and happy with one's self.
A Fixed Mindset when faced with:
               >Challenges: Avoids a challenge looking for the easy way out     Obstacles: Loses focus and is enticed by the next big thing/fast money get rich quick schemes     Effort: Applies little effort with the feeling it's pointless already has a mindset of failure     criticism: Ignores and views as hate or putting down   Success of others: views as threat and is jealous of others. In the end never reaches full potential due to being focused on what other people are doing and not having the courage to do it themselves.
     This lesson is for me because I started with a fixed mindset and have grown into the growth mindset
     There are some attributes of a growth mindset that I had and others I lacked. I was always celebratory of everyone except myself. I always believed in and encouraged others but wouldn't do the same for me. I had to learn to build myself up in the same way I did for others and not speak negatively or badly about myself. Once I began to practice that, my goals were easier to achieve despite the obstacles.
     __The main goal I am learning now is to be consistent in my growth mindset and not go back and forth from one to the other.  That can cause you to be stuck as well.
     When I catch myself falling into negativity I immediately stop and find ways to say the positive thing and the thing that speaks life into my situation. I'm now finding that instead of saying "this doesn't work" to "how can I make this work?"
